### Project Overview

 This project uses multiple numpy methods to facilitate data wrangling from a large dataset.


### Learnings from the project

 Masking proves to be a very important asset often for array subsetting. I'm planning to use it in next projects, extensively.
Amazed to see how some functions like len() have such versatile applicability across strings, arrays, numpy arrays and i wonder where else...


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 -Extensive googling.
-Multiple similar type examples solved on other platforms.
-Exact copy created and solved ad resolved on local system.
-Found multiple methods to do the same thing (with subtle differences)
-Satisfied implementer's expectation (Bcuz online compilers are taught to recognise one specific method only - which is so frus.... :p)


### Challenges faced

 Mentioned in approach itself.
Google is my best buddy
